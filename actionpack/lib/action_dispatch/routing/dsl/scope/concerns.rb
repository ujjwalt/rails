      class Scope < AbstractScope
        # Define a routing concern using a name.
        #
        # Concerns may be defined inline, using a block, or handled by
        # another object, by passing that object as the second parameter.
        #
        # The concern object, if supplied, should respond to <tt>call</tt>,
        # which will receive two parameters:
        #
        #   * The current mapper
        #   * A hash of options which the concern object may use
        #
        # Options may also be used by concerns defined in a block by accepting
        # a block parameter. So, using a block, you might do something as
        # simple as limit the actions available on certain resources, passing
        # standard resource options through the concern:
        #
        #   concern :commentable do |options|
        #     resources :comments, options
        #   end
        #
        #   resources :posts, concerns: :commentable
        #   resources :archived_posts do
        #     # Don't allow comments on archived posts
        #     concerns :commentable, only: [:index, :show]
        #   end
        #
        # Or, using a callable object, you might implement something more
        # specific to your application, which would be out of place in your
        # routes file.
